Project 1 : Sales Forecasting using Linear Regression

Project Overview
This project aims to predict future sales revenue based on historical data using Linear Regression, a fundamental supervised machine learning technique. The model is trained on synthetic time-series sales data and produces both graphical and tabular forecasts for the next 30 days.

Problem Statement
Businesses often struggle to accurately forecast future sales, which impacts decision-making around inventory, staffing, and marketing. This project builds a simple regression-based solution to address this problem using past sales data.

Objectives
Generate a clean synthetic dataset of daily sales (date, quantity, revenue).

Preprocess and prepare the data for modeling.

Apply Linear Regression to model and forecast future sales.

Visualize actual vs predicted values and generate a 30-day forecast.

Evaluate model performance using RÂ² and MSE.
